<h3>MODESTY                    _Paul Hervieu_ </h3>
<p>
    HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?<br>
    
    JACQUES. You can easily guess.<br>
    
    HENRIETTE. You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.<br>
    
    JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
    am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?<br>
    
    HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
    good friends! And now you're going to be angry.<br>
    
    JACQUES. Why?<br>
    
    HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
    like.<br>
